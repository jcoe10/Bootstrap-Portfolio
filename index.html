            <p>Hello. My name is Jacob. I was born in Altamonte Springs Florida. I have loved technology and learning about it since I was a kid. The biggest achievement in my life was when I became an Eagle Scout at 18 years old. It was a great experience in my life and truly changed who I was and who I am now. I enjoy the outdoors, camping, and fishing.</p>
            <p>I competed in robotics with SkillsUSA while I was dual-enrolling at Mid Florida Tech in Electronics Technology and won several gold medals as an officer in the program. </p>
            <p>I love video games. I love all types of music because I used to DJ some for fun. I love traveling to new and exotic places to learn culture and basic languages. I enjoy going out with friends and having fun. I am in this program to ultimately change my life and my career path to do something I love to do.</p>
